This is my resume as of March 2016. The template was taken from http://www.latextemplates.com/template/stylish-cv. It must be compiled with XeLaTeX.

If you have never used LaTeX before and would like to use this template, I recommend getting (Texmaker)[http://www.xm1math.net/texmaker/]

To use as is, you will need to install the Adobe Garamond Pro font
